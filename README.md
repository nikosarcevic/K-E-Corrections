# K-E-Corrections
A repository for a DESC Sprint 2023

The purpose of this sprint is to tackle the problem of color (k+e) corrections that are currently being used in our forecasts.
Issue is that we are currently using outdated corrections for wrong cosmology. The problem is that these incosnistencies propagate into our IA amplitude so obtaining something meaningful is extremely important.
